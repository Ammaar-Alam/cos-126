Programming Assignment 4:  Recursive Graphics


/******************************************************************************

 ******************************************************************************/

Number of hours: 1-3 (For first two) then like 12+ for the second one (i could've been
done wayyyy sooner but I was really determined to get a good looking Art.java fractal



/******************************************************************************

 ******************************************************************************/
The artistic creation is inspired by a 3D cube fractal, where each cube is
representedby a hexagon that mimics the appearance of a 3D cube. The hexagons
are further embellished with internal hexagons to enhance the 3D effect.
The design is fractal-like, using mutual and conditional recursion to create a
complex pattern. Each hexagon is annotated with its recursion level, which also
dictates its color to some extent.

To be entirely honest, I really liked the example fractal drawn by Gerry Wan,
and I spent like at least 6-8hours trying to recreate his exactly because I
thought the design was so cool, but for the life of me I could not. So I ended
up settling for this, which i dont think is as cool as his was, but I think it
looks cool enough.

Weird request: but is it possible for me to see his code for the program? I
genuinely spent like 12-14hours trying to replicate his, I even got the hexagon
recursion down, and used a version of it in my own code, but I for the life of
me cannot get his colouring down üò≠

if it's possible, im reallllly curious to see how he did it üôèüèº

    [ ] call one or more Transform2D method

    [X] use different StdDraw methods than in examples (e.g.,
        ellipses, arcs, text)

    [X] number of recursive calls not constant per level (e.g.,
        conditional recursion)

    [X] mutually recursive methods

    [X] multiple recursive methods

    [X] doesn't always recur from level n to level n-1

    [ ] draw between recursive calls, not just before/after all
        recursive calls

    [X] use recursive level for secondary purpose (e.g., level
        dictates color)
